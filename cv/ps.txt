A Machine Learning Software Engineer with over 7 years of hands-on experience building and deploying scalable production systems across machine learning, LLMs, and intelligent data infrastructure. My background spans startups, enterprise AI, research, and product development, giving me the versatility to solve complex, ambiguous problems and deliver pragmatic, business-driven solutions.

I specialize in building full-stack ML and GenAI systems — from data engineering pipelines and MLOps orchestration to RAG architectures, custom model training, and feedback loops. I've designed end-to-end document intelligence pipelines, real-time medical data anonymization engines, and AI-powered document classification tools using layered models and modular APIs. I'm equally fluent in classic ML techniques (time series, probabilistic forecasting, SHAP, boosting, GANs) as well as modern GenAI tooling like LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, and vector search with Qdrant, FAISS, and Azure Cognitive Search.

My infrastructure experience includes deploying models with FastAPI, Redis queues, Azure Functions, Kubernetes, and Docker in cloud-native environments like GCP, Azure, and AWS. I bring a strong focus on observability, versioning, and CI/CD using MLflow, Langfuse, Datadog, and automated online training pipelines. I’ve led the design and deployment of complex, human-in-the-loop systems that evolve based on user feedback and are monitored with deep evaluation metrics like RAGAS and LLM-as-a-Judge.

Beyond engineering, I bring strong cross-functional collaboration skills and have worked closely with product, compliance, and executive teams to translate technical complexity into business value. My work includes developing real-time forecasting dashboards for insurers, building LLM pipelines for document summarization and search, and architecting scalable feedback loops for improving generative AI outputs.

Whether it's deploying a real-time document OCR pipeline on Azure, leading an end-to-end GenAI initiative, or integrating a regex fallback for insurance document classification, I aim to bring clarity to complexity and build systems that are robust, observable, and continuously improving.
