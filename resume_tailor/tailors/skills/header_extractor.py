        "- Headers must group **related skills or tools** under a common category\n"
        "- Avoid overly broad terms like 'General Skills', 'Miscellaneous', or 'Abilities'\n"
        "- Avoid merged or compound phrases like 'A & B' or slashes like 'A/B'.\n"
        "- Do not include soft skills, personal traits, or generic attributes\n"
        "- A header **can be a single-topic umbrella** even if it maps to one small area\n"
        "## Examples from Various Domains (not exhaustive):\n"
        "- Education: 'Instructional Design', 'Classroom Technology'\n"
        "- Finance: 'Risk Modeling', 'Compliance Tools'\n"
        "- Healthcare: 'Patient Information Systems', 'Clinical Operations'\n"
        "- Retail: 'Inventory Systems', 'Point-of-Sale Platforms'\n"
        "- Marketing: 'Digital Campaign Tools', 'Analytics Platforms'\n"
        "- Logistics: 'Fleet Management Systems', 'Warehouse Technology'\n\n"
